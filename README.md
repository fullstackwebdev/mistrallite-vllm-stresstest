Good people, the Cunliffes.”\n\nThe women joined them then and opened the house. Willow took a roll of trash bags from her backpack, and she went around collecting the items Hawthorne read to her off a list. Maelor was surprised. They had everything worked out and only very rarely one of them said, “Oh look. I forgot about that. Do we want it?”\n\nOnce the items on the list were stacked by the front door, the two men were set to cleaning the house while the women disappeared into their bedrooms to pack their clothing. That night Hawthorne and Willow slept in their parents’ bed while the two men slept in the women’s rooms. Maelor had thought it might be sexy being in Hawthorne’s bed, but so much of the room had been packed up it felt blank and empty, almost as if it wasn’t hers anymore.

Also the brown dye was fading from the sister’s hair, the red more prominent every day, and that made Hawthorne even prettier in his eyes.\n\n“The house looks real nice. We should have no trouble getting you a good price,” promised the realtor.\n\n“I bet they say that to everyone,” muttered Willow.\n\n“Very likely, but it does look good,” said Dylan.\n\n“Lock the house up and let’s go,” said Maelor.\n\n“Now?” asked Willow.\n\n“You’ve gotten everything you want?
